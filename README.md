# Civ5Draft
A little program I made in java for civ 5.
When actived it will first ask you how many players are there.
Then it will ask if you want to ban any civ.
After that it will ask if you want to add any civs to the list that are either a mod civ or one you accidently ban.
Then it will ask you if you want 1 or 3 civs given to each person and if you want them to be unique or not.
If you choose unique it will remove the civ it gives each player from the list making it impossible to get the same civ.
If you choose the other option everyone could end up getting Egypt.
